      question: "Do you provide the hose for water slides?",
      answer: "No, the customer must provide a standard garden hose that reaches the setup location. We provide the attachments to connect your hose directly to the slide's misting system."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I set up an inflatable on concrete or asphalt?",
      answer: "Yes! We can set up on grass, concrete, asphalt, or indoors. However, you MUST tell us the surface type during booking. For grass, we use deep heavy-duty stakes. For hard surfaces, we must bring heavy sandbags to safely anchor the unit, which requires extra preparation."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the power requirement for the mechanical bull?",
      answer: "The mechanical bull requires two (2) separate 20-amp, 110v circuits within 100 feet of the setup area. One circuit powers the motion of the bull, and the other powers the inflatable landing ring. If you don't have adequate power, we rent generators."
    },
    {
      question: "Are your inflatables safe?",
      answer: "Yes. All our units are commercial-grade, lead-free vinyl with safety netting. We are fully insured and our staff is trained in SIOTO (Safe Inflatable Operators Training Organization) standards for proper anchoring and setup."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to keep the blower running?",
      answer: "Yes, the blower must run continuously while the inflatable is in use. If you turn the blower off, the unit will deflate. The blowers use a standard 110v outlet."
