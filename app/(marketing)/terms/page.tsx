          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">Normal wear and tear is expected. However, the renter is responsible for any damage caused by negligence, misuse, or failure to follow the provided safety rules. This includes, but is not limited to: cuts, tears, Silly String damage, food/drink stains, pet damage, or unauthorized moving of the equipment.</p>

            <p className="text-red-800 m-0"><strong>Absolutely NO SILLY STRING is allowed in or near any inflatable.</strong> Silly String permanently stains and degrades the vinyl. If Silly String is found on the unit, the renter will be charged a minimum $500 cleaning/repair fee, up to the full replacement cost of the unit.</p>

Please clear the area of rocks, sharp objects, animal debris, and ensure overhead clearance (no low-hanging branches or power lines). Setup delays caused by an unprepared site may result in additional hourly fees or project cancellation.</p>
